This R package provides ready-to-use HTML output formats and templates for
RMarkdown documents. The goal is to produce clean documents "out of the box",
with or without the RStudio IDE.

## Formats

The package provides two HTML output formats :

- the `readthedown` format
- the `html_clean` format 
- the `html_docco` format 



## Creating a new document

### Within RStudio

Choose `File` > `New File...` > `R Markdown...`, then select `From Template`.
You should then be able to create a new document from one of the package
templates.

### Without RStudio

The `create.doc()` function allows you to create a new directory with a clean
ready-to-use RMarkdown file. `create.doc()` gets two main arguments :

- `dirname` is the name of the folder and RMarkdown file to be created
- `format` is the format name (`"readthedown"`, `"html_clean"` or `"html_docco"`)

By default, a `Makefile` file will be created in the new folder for direct
rendering from the command line.

## Rendering

### With RStudio

Rendering from within RStudio should be quite simple : just click the `Knit` button.

### Rendering from R

You can render your document into HTML directly from within R with the
`render()` function from the `rmarkdown` package :

```r
library(rmarkdown)
render("mydocument.Rmd")
```

### Rendering with the Makefile

If you created your `.Rmd` file with the `create.doc()` function, you can then
generate HTML or PDF files with :

```    
make html
make pdf
```

You can also clean out any generated files and cache with :

```
make clean
```

## Extra features and helpers

Some extra features are available depending on the format :

- `readthedown` is fully responsive, with collapsible navigation
- `html_clean` and `readthedown` provide an automatic and dynamic table of contents
- `html_clean` and `html_docco` provide automatic thumbnails for figures with lightbox display

The package also provides a `create.doc()` function as well as RStudio document
templates to easily generate an empty and ready to use rmarkdown file with
several configuration directives.

Finally, it also provides the `pilltabs()` helper function, which allows to display a crosstab dynamically. See [one of the output samples](https://rawgit.com/juba/rmdformats/master/resources/examples/html_clean/html_clean_sample.html#Table) for a live example.
